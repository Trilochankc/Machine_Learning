The analysis of classification models for predicting test
preparation status yielded valuable insights into the performance and suitability of different algorithms. Across the
models evaluated, Random Forest emerged with the highest
accuracy of 61.81%, closely followed by Support Vector
Classifier (SVC) with an accuracy of 66.11%. Notably, SVC
exhibited superior precision, recall, and F1-scores for identifying instances of completed test preparation, while Random
Forest demonstrated balanced performance across both classes
(”Completed” and ”None”). On the other hand, Decision
Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Na¨ıve Bayes presented
slightly lower accuracies ranging from 51% to 59.72%. Although these models showed reasonable performance metrics
for specific classes, they did not match the overall performance
of SVC and Random Forest. In practical terms, the findings
suggest that SVC and Random Forest are promising candidates
for predicting test preparation status in this dataset due to their
higher accuracy and balanced performance across precision,
recall, and F1-score metrics. However, further refinement
and validation, including hyperparameter tuning and assessing
model robustness, are essential to ensure the reliability and
generalizability of the selected model. Overall, this study
underscores the importance of employing appropriate machine
learning techniques to enhance our understanding of student
behavior and academic performance. By leveraging predictive
modeling, educators and policymakers can gain actionable
insights to tailor interventions and support mechanisms that
promote effective test preparation strategies and ultimately
improve student outcomes.
